# Proprioceptor
gate-control-theory application

                  Welcome into the proprioceptor project

---Theory---
This programm will help you to release pain with the use of mechanical 
vibrations (without ionisation as it is used to be in the transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation, T.E.N.S therapy)
You place the vibration device on the painful area and let the 
-Gate control- effect relieve you (Melzack,R. Wall, PD. 1965).
the vibrations's forces and amplitudes will vary in order to getting accomodated
to the vibration. 

Precautions and contraindications: 
Talk to your general practitioner (GP) about the proprioceptor its vibrations.
contraindications: if you are pregnant / if you have a fracture / 
if you have any electronic devices / further contraindications that can be
identified by your GP.
Precautions : if you have osteosynthesis materials such as prothesis, metal) /
if you have epilepsia.

---Technic---
 
load the -basic-code-proprioceptor.ino (with the help of 
the adafruit_DRV2605_library (B) and the wire.h (C) libarary of 
the adafruit_arduino_boards) into an adafruit arduino board, connect it with
a vibator motor and a battery, wrap it all inside a case and patch the device 
on an electrode and stick it on the skin of the painful aera.
- the code will help you to feel a vibration and activate the gate-control- and
keep the vibration detected by your nerval system.

--> this is a health prevention care and it is recommended that your seek 
a medical assistance before applying the vibration device into your skin.
